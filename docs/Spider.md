# Overview

Spider is a specialized scraping method which returns an object with a collection of links and assets. The links can be used
to spider other documents and follow a web tree.  The assets object can be used to inspect or retrieve assets found in the HTML 
markup spidered.

[NOTE: Need examples of how this might work]
